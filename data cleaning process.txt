Froze the headers for a start from the View pane

Trimmed columns with the TRIM function 

Wrote a formula to return time of the day from the time of 
incident

Removed duplicate rows and rows with abysmally incosistent detailing

Wrote another formula to return the centuries from which these
attacks occured. i did this with the IF Statement 
>> 
=IF(AND(C:C>1900, C:C<=2000), "20th Century", IF(AND(C:C>2000, C:C<=3000), "21st Century", IF(AND(C:C>1800, C:C<=1900), "19th Century", IF(AND(C:C>1700, C:C<=1800), "18th Century", IF(AND(C:C>1600, C:C<=1700), "17th Century", IF(AND(C:C>1500, C:C<=1600), "16th Century", "Unknown"))))))

Imported table to MySQL for further cleaning where i checked for misspelt values 

I also made a comprehensive grouping of shark species with SQL using Wildcards, the CASE statement and Subqueries
>>
SELECT shark_specie, SUM(sharkfam) sharkgroup
FROM 
	(SELECT 
		CASE
			WHEN species LIKE '%white%' THEN 'White Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%Tiger%' THEN 'Tiger Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%Bull%' THEN 'Bull Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%Bronze%' THEN 'Bronze Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%Sand%' THEN 'Sand Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%zambesi%' THEN 'Zambesi Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%wobbegong%' THEN 'Wobbegong Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%silk%' THEN 'Silky Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%shovel%' THEN 'Shovel_nosed Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%nurse%' THEN 'Nurse Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%mako%' THEN 'Mako Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%leop%' THEN 'Leopard Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%hammer%' THEN 'Hammerhead Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%thresh%' THEN 'Thresher Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%spin%' THEN 'Spinner Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%ragged%' THEN 'Raggedtooth Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%lem%' THEN 'Lemon Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%reef%' THEN 'Gray Reef Shark'
			WHEN species LIKE '%porb%' THEN 'Porbeagle Shark'

			WHEN species LIKE ''  THEN 'Null' 
			WHEN species LIKE '%confirm%' OR 
				species LIKE '%iden%' OR 
				species LIKE'%invol%' OR
				species LIKE '%ques%' OR
				species LIKE '%doub%'
			THEN 'Uncomfired Shark Involvement'
			ELSE Species
			END AS shark_specie,
		Species,
		COUNT(Species) sharkfam
	FROM `shark attacks`
	GROUP BY shark_specie, Species
	ORDER BY 3 DESC) genus
GROUP BY shark_specie
ORDER BY sharkgroup DESC

I then asked questions like;
Victims' Activites before Attack 

Countries with the most shark attacks (Filter by Era)

Where has the most shark attacks occured 

Time of the day attacks occured the most
